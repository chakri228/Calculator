# Calculator
A basic Android calculator application built with Java, designed for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates the implementation of Android UI components like EditText, Button, and TextView, and handles user input validation and basic error handling (e.g., division by zero). The app showcases the use of listeners for button clicks and updates results dynamically.

Features:

*  Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

*  User Input Validation: Ensures that input fields are not empty and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

*  Error Handling: Prevents division by zero with appropriate error messages.

*  Clean and Simple UI: A minimalistic layout that is easy to navigate.

Tech Stack:

*  Language: Java

*  Framework: Android SDK

*  Build Tool: Gradle
